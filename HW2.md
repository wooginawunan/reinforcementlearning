# Question 1: Imitation learning

1. Make necessary changes to the starter code to make it work for Behaviour cloning. Submit code as a zip file.

Code in: https://github.com/wooginawunan/reinforcementlearning/

2. Attach images of frames/data that you collected in 1 page of your PDF submission.

3. Attach images of frames/data that your behavior cloned policy produces in 1 page of your PDF submission.


4. Attach a curve that shows how important is the number of datapoints for behavior cloning in your PDF submission. In this curve, x-axis is the number of training examples and y-axis is the performance of the behavior cloning policy.


5. Additionally, attach screenshots, logs along with anything you feel is necessary as proof that your code worked in your PDF submission.


6. Write up any tricks you had to use to make behavior cloning work better.


7. Extra credit: Implement DAGGER and show how it can obtain better results than behavior cloning.
